# Original Samples
Descriptions of files that were analyzed as part of the original data present in [original
HiChIP paper](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.3999.html). 
Notably, these sample's QC metrics are very consistent and appear to be of high quality as the 
proportion of long range interactions exceeds 20 percent.

While each sample looks mostly successful in terms of long range interactions, we observe significant heterogeneity in ChIP efficacies as 
the % of reads in anchors varies considerably within sample batches.
