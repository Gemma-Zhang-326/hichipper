Three samples were created from random downsampling of the GM12878 HiChIP experiment with
1 million, 500,000 and 250,000 reads. As the proportion of long range interactions remains
relatively constant, we suggest that a relatively small number of reads may be sufficient 
to determine library quality before performing a deeper sequencing run.
