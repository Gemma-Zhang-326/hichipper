# Original Samples

Notably, these sample's QC metrics are very consistent and appear to be of high quality as the 
proportion of long range interactions exceeds 20 percent.

# Variable Cell Inputs
Compiled HTML for [1 million](https://cdn.rawgit.com/aryeelab/hichipper/master/qcReports/Good/Mumbach_etal/1mil.hichipper.html) [5 million](https://cdn.rawgit.com/aryeelab/hichipper/master/qcReports/Good/Mumbach_etal/5mil.hichipper.html) [10 million](https://cdn.rawgit.com/aryeelab/hichipper/master/qcReports/Good/Mumbach_etal/10mil.hichipper.html)

While each sample looks mostly successful, we note the lower proportion of long range interactions in the 5 million cell count relative 
to the other samples. As the 1 million cell sample looks slightly better, we cannot determine, at least from these samples,
that reduced cellular input has a direct effect on library quality.  

# downsampled

Three samples were created from random downsampling of the GM12878 HiChIP experiment with
1 million, 500,000 and 250,000 reads. As the proportion of long range interactions remains
relatively constant, we suggest that a relatively small number of reads may be sufficient 
to determine library quality before performing a deeper sequencing run.
