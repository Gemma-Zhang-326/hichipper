## HighQuality_SMC1
What makes this sample high quality? Look at the histogram and notice the relative height 
of the peak around 100,000 bp compared to the original other samples. The difference in relative
heights of the peaks is roughly 10x compared to roughly 2x for the samples described in the original
manuscript. The proportion of PETs mapping to loops is relatively low, but this can be attributed
to the fewer number of anchors called. This sample may benefit from different anchor definitions
or more sequencing depth to identify these anchor regions.
